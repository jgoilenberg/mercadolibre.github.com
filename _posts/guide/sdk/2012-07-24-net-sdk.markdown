#.NET SDK

The .NET SDK enables you to access the API from a web application developed in [Microsoft .NET](http://www.microsoft.com/net) and [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com).
It hides all the complexity of OAuth 2.0 and lets you focus on writing application code.

You'll find the source code in the following location: [https://github.com/mercadolibre/net-sdk](https://github.com/mercadolibre/net-sdk)

With the source code you'll find documentation on how to use the SDK.
    
If you want to contribute or you find something that needs to be fixed, just fork our SDK in [GitHub](https://github.com/mercadolibre/net-sdk) and pull requests as needed or get in touch through our [contact](/discuss) page
